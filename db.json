The idea came about after Golding read what he deemed to be an unrealistic depiction of stranded children in youth novels like The Coral Island: a Tale of the Pacific Ocean (1857) by R. M. Ballantyne, and asked his wife, Ann, if it would be a good idea if I wrote a book about children on an island, children who behave in the way children really would behave [3] As a result, the novel contains various references to The Coral Island, such as the rescuing naval officer s description of the boys initial attempts at civilised cooperation as a jolly good show, like the Coral Island.[4] Goldings three central characters (Ralph, Piggy, and Jack) have also been interpreted as caricatures of Ballantynes Coral Island protagonists.",
